title: why this blog
---

so why another blog?

after i finished school and civil service i went to university with the vision of being alone as much as possible.

yes, being alone, no friends, just enjoying the solitude.

i felt like i needed this. so i started this experiment. and it is a nice experience, you learn a lot about yourself. but what i noticed is that thoughts don't develop as they used to.

i am missing the talking.

when i occasionally explain something to someoneor just discuss on a topic, while i am talking i am making up an opinion and on-the-fly finding conclusions which i didn't reach in solitude, not talking.

so i need to find a way to talk. still i don't want to break my experiment with the silence. so i will talk to my self, only in a non-creepy-way and where others can benefit too.

voila, this blog has a reason, and although i am not the first one blogging for myself, there is a real personal reason for this blog. let the fun begin!
