The management consultany
[Gruber-Consulting.net](http://gruber-consulting.net/), I previously
created a page for ([original
post](/posts/2009/11/16/gruber-consulting-net.html)) also
wanted me to design matching business cards for them in order to improve
their branding. They follow a color scheme quite similar to the webpage
and feature the same logotype. Here are the different revisions of the
design:

Dark background and big Helvetica type

![Business Card rev 1](/images/ub-gruber.de/vk-1.jpg)

Removed border on behalf of the client and swapped colors

![Business Card rev 3](/images/ub-gruber.de/vk-3.jpg)

Added the borders again, this revision was then sent out to print
