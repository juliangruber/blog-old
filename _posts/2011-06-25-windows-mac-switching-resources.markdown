###[srware iron](http://www.srware.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=2441)

a browser that is essentially google chrome, but without the google. in my experience it is the fastest and most stable while best to use browser on the market. recommended extensions:

* [adblock plus for google chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb)
* [disconnect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jeoacafpbcihiomhlakheieifhpjdfeo)

> "If you find yourself rewriting the same lines of code, the same paragraphs, even the same signature over and over each day, you’re doing it wrong. How many hours each year would you save, simply by turning an eight second repetitive typing task into a keystroke? Especially in my particular circumstance, TextExpander is 100% a necessity.
