My newest work that I'm proud to present to you is the creation of a
full-featured website for a german Knights/Middle Age club called
[Ritterschaft zu Wasserstein](http://ritterschaft-zu-wasserstein.de/).

It took about 3 months planning everything out, designing the frontend,
laying out the pages and creating the underlying Content Management
System.

Again I used the great [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/)
[PHP](http://www.php.net/)-Framework, [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/),
[XHTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML),
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)with
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/),
[CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) with
[Blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/) and [Adobe
Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop/).

The Content Management System enables easy

-   creating
-   editing
-   reordering and
-   deleting

of

-   text-bricks
-   members
-   videos
-   events
-   blog-posts
-   links
-   pictures
-   and the adjustment of various settings.

Especially to mention is the picture slider on the frontpage and the use
of HTML5 and CSS3 on the backend to create clean rounded corners with
managable code (as you can see in the pictures below).

Thanks to the [Ritterschaft zu
Wasserstein](http://ritterschaft-zu-wasserstein.de/) for being such a
great client to work with!
