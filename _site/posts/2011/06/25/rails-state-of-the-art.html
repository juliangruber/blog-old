<p>my comment on the somewhat controversal last railsconf talk by rails founder david heinemeier hansson (i recommend you watch his talk first if you haven't yet).</p>

<h3>magic 13</h3>

<pre><code>13 files in one directory -&gt; :(
13 methods in one class   -&gt; :(
</code></pre>

<p>true.</p>

<h3>asset pipeline</h3>

<p>nice for big sites like the 37signals ones, but again a hassle for smaller sites. and a lot of sites start rather small. this might push even more developers towards sinatra.</p>

<h3>code cops</h3>

<p>and what's about david heinemeier hanssons's initial talk about ruby with freedom and risk and monkeypatching and stuff, now he is talking about laws, enforcements and code cops :(</p>

<h3>asset structure</h3>

<p>however filing the js- and css-files in a perfect folder structure on the backend and then serving them combined, minimized (and cached) is rather neat: lower filesize, fewer ttp requests, faster development.</p>

<h3>unix</h3>

<p>some critizise that the learning curve for rails is becoming steeper and steeper, possibly turning a lot of developers away from it.</p>

<p>but might this not be just like with unix? a steep learning curve which always pays off in the end? only to a certain extent because unix allows simple flexible solutions whereas rails has this enforcing structure (convention over configuration).</p>

<h3>vendor libraries</h3>

<p>divorcing self written js from vendor js libs is a good idea.
now you can install js libs also as gems and don't need to have them hang around in your directory structure. the only downside i see in this is that for quick code lookup in those files while development you have to get it from somewhere else.</p>

<p>and the same works equally well for css frameworks (if you use them<sup>^)</sup></p>

<h3>coffeescript</h3>

<p>the inclusion of coffeescript isn't necessary, couldn't the just enable easy coffeescript integration?</p>

<p>-> they help make coffeescript a standard which i myself appreciate</p>

<p>but don't you have to have node.js installed on the server for coffeescript? this could become a huge problem for people tied to shared hosting environments. but hey, lets push those companies towards the future and demand it!</p>

<p>(btw: the coffeescript compiler is written in coffeescript which is totally awesome)</p>

<p>and they have automatic recompilation of changed .coffee-files already built in which is also totally awesome.</p>

<h3>updated generators</h3>

<p>when you generate a new controller, the generator autogenerates coffee &amp; scss-files for you. while this could generate some unnecessary files, for the scope of applications rails targets for js is propably needed for every controller.</p>

<h3>automatic parser chaining</h3>

<pre><code>posts.css.scss.erb
</code></pre>

<p>this says that posts.css should be parsed by erb and then by scss. thats very nice, dynamic css just got easier.</p>

<h3>default libraries</h3>

<p>although scss is the default css library you can easily witch to less e.g. by changing one config file. good for everyone!</p>

<h3>defaults over no-defaults</h3>

<p>rails stands for faster and easier development vs for example the classical unix approach: more configuration, but more flexibility. now what do you prefer?</p>

<p>i prefer both. can't we have both?</p>

<h3>framework vs library</h3>

<p>framework: have features enabled by default. disable what you don't need
library: have nothing enabled by default. pick and configure what you need.</p>

<h3>middleware</h3>

<p>this js/css compiling, minifying, filename-based-caching is cool, but do you know if they have this implemented as an independent racks middleware? would be cool to use in also not-rails-projects.</p>
