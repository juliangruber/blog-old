   <p>so why another blog?</p>

<p>after i finished school and civil service i went to university with the vision of being alone as much as possible.</p>

<p>yes, being alone, no friends, just enjoying the solitude.</p>

<p>i felt like i needed this. so i started this experiment. and it is a nice experience, you learn a lot about yourself. but what i noticed is that thoughts don't develop as they used to.</p>

<p>i am missing the talking.</p>

<p>when i occasionally explain something to someoneor just discuss on a topic, while i am talking i am making up an opinion and on-the-fly finding conclusions which i didn't reach in solitude, not talking.</p>

<p>so i need to find a way to talk. still i don't want to break my experiment with the silence. so i will talk to my self, only in a non-creepy-way and where others can benefit too.</p>

<p>voila, this blog has a reason, and although i am not the first one blogging for myself, there is a real personal reason for this blog. let the fun begin!</p>
